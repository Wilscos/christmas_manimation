A Christmas animation made in manim to gift to friend and/or relatives. Have fun!

If you want to modify it a bit and add some other stuff just fork the repository and do whatever you want. Happy holidays! 🎅

I suggest adding a Christmas song up to the point when the Christmas tree starts rotating. From the start of the rotation to the end you could add a different song (maybe a funny one 😏).
